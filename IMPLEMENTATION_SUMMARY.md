## 🚀 Next Steps (IMPORTANT!)

### Step 1: Run the Database Migration

You **MUST** run the migration to create the new tables and functions:

#### Option A: Using Supabase Dashboard (Easiest)

1. Open your Supabase project: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Go to **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
3. Click **"New Query"**
4. Open file: `supabase/migrations/20251006000001_add_businesses_and_features.sql`
5. Copy the entire contents and paste into SQL Editor
6. Click **"Run"** or press `Ctrl+Enter`
7. Wait for success message

#### Option B: Using Supabase CLI

```bash
# If Supabase CLI is installed
supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
supabase db push
```

### Step 2: Verify Migration Success

After running migration, check in Supabase Dashboard:

1. Go to **Table Editor**
2. Verify these tables exist:
   - ✅ `businesses`
   - ✅ `social_clicks`
   - ✅ `reviews`
3. Check `profiles` table has new columns:
   - ✅ `account_type`
   - ✅ `business_id`

### Step 3: Test the Application

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Then test these flows:

1. **Search for Business**
   - Go to homepage
   - Type in search box
   - See autocomplete results

2. **Create Business Profile**
   - Sign in to Dashboard
   - Click floating "Convert to Business" button
   - Fill form and submit
   - Should navigate to business detail page

3. **Social Click Tracking**
   - View any business detail page
   - Click social media buttons
   - Should turn green with checkmark
   - Reload page - checkmarks should persist

4. **Leave Verified Review**
   - Click social links on business page
   - Click "Write a Review"
   - Should see "Verified Reviewer" green banner
   - Submit review
   - Review should have green verified badge

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Before Using in Production

1. **Run Migration** - Absolutely required before app works
2. **Test Thoroughly** - Test all user flows end-to-end
3. **Check RLS Policies** - Verify security policies work correctly
4. **Set Up Error Monitoring** - Track any issues in production
5. **Backup Database** - Always backup before migrations

### Known Limitations

- Search requires minimum 2 characters
- Reviews limited to one per user per business
- Social clicks don't track external analytics (only in-app)
- Business verification requires manual admin approval

### Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Advanced search filters (location, category, rating)
- Business hours with open/closed status
- Photo galleries for businesses
- Review responses from business owners
- Email notifications for new reviews
- Analytics dashboard for business owners

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Migration Issues

**Problem:** "Relation already exists" error  
**Solution:** Tables might already exist. Drop them first or skip those sections

**Problem:** Permission denied  
**Solution:** Check you're logged in to correct Supabase project

### Runtime Issues

**Problem:** Search returns no results  
**Solution:** Ensure businesses exist with `is_active = true`

**Problem:** Social clicks not tracking  
**Solution:** User must be signed in. Check auth state in console.

**Problem:** Reviews not verified  
**Solution:** User must click social link BEFORE reviewing

**Problem:** Convert button not showing  
**Solution:** Account must be 'personal' type. Check profiles table.

console.log('User:', user);

// Check social clicks
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('social_clicks')
  .select('*')
  .eq('user_id', user.id);
console.log('Clicks:', data);

// Test search function directly
const { data } = await supabase.rpc('search_businesses', {
  search_query: 'test',
  result_limit: 10
});
console.log('Results:', data);
```

### Performance

- Search is debounced (300ms)
