# 🎯 Quick Setup: Google Review QR Code

## Step 1: Save the QR Code Image

You have an image that looks like this:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│         Google Logo             │
│   Check us out on Google        │
│                                 │
│   ┌───────────────────┐        │
│   │ [QR CODE IMAGE]   │        │
│   │                   │        │
│   │  Colorful Border  │        │
│   └───────────────────┘        │
│                                 │
│  Anand Travel Agency Inc        │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Step 2: Prepare the Image

1. **Extract just the QR code** from the image (the black and white square part)
2. **Recommended size**: 256x256 pixels or larger
3. **Format**: PNG (supports transparency)
4. **Name**: `google-review-qr.png`

## Step 3: Save to Public Folder

Save the image here:
```
get-review/
└── public/
    └── google-review-qr.png  ← Save here
```

## Step 4: Verify

1. Open your website
2. Scroll down to the "Check us out on Google" section
3. The QR code should display with a colorful border
4. Test scanning with your phone

## Alternative: If You Don't Have the Image

If the image is not available, the website will automatically show a fallback:
- 📱 Phone emoji
- "Google" text
- "Check us out on Google" message
- "Scan to Review" text

This still looks professional and functional!

## The QR Code Section Features

When properly displayed, users will see:
- ✨ Large QR code with Google's colorful border
- ⭐ Floating animated stars
- 🎯 "Leave a Review" button
- 📱 Scan or click to review
- 💫 Premium animations

## Testing the QR Code

1. **Scan with phone camera**
2. Should open: `https://g.page/r/CRF3AUEXTuzdEAE/review`
3. User can leave a Google review
4. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 5-star reviews!

**Note**: The website works perfectly even without the QR image. The fallback looks professional and functional. But adding the actual QR code makes it even better for quick scanning!
