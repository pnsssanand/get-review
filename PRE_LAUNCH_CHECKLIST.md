GROUP BY user_id, business_id, platform 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Check reviews are unique per user/business
SELECT user_id, business_id, COUNT(*) 
FROM reviews 
GROUP BY user_id, business_id 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Check verified reviews have social clicks
SELECT r.id, r.verified, 
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM social_clicks sc 
        WHERE sc.user_id = r.user_id 
        AND sc.business_id = r.business_id) as click_count
FROM reviews r;

-- Check business owners have valid user_id
SELECT b.id, b.owner_id, p.id
