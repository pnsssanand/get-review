## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. **Profile.tsx** (`src/pages/Profile.tsx`)

#### Added Features:
- **Import Edit Icon:** Added `Edit` icon from lucide-react
- **Import Light Theme CSS:** Added `import "./ProfileLight.css"`
- **Owner Check Logic:** Added `isOwner` check to determine if current user owns the profile
- **Edit My Profile Button:** Owner-only button in navigation bar
- **Hidden Sections:** Removed display of:
  - Progress Card (task completion tracking)
  - Quick Actions (small tasks grid)
  - Featured Links (large tasks list)
- **Welcome Message:** Added clean welcome card instead of links

#### Navigation Bar Changes:
```tsx
<nav className="border-b border-border/50 backdrop-blur-sm bg-white/80 sticky top-0 z-50">
  <div className="container mx-auto px-4 py-4 flex justify-between items-center">
    <Button variant="ghost" size="sm" onClick={() => navigate("/")}>
      <ArrowLeft className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
      Back to Home
    </Button>
    
    {isOwner && (
      <Button
        variant="default"
        size="sm"
        onClick={() => navigate("/dashboard")}
        className="bg-gradient-to-r from-amber-500 to-purple-600 hover:from-amber-600 hover:to-purple-700 text-white"
      >
        <Edit className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
        Edit My Profile
      </Button>
    )}
  </div>
</nav>
```

#### Owner Check Logic:
```tsx
const isOwner = currentUser?.id === userId;
```

#### Hidden Content:
- All social links sections are commented out with clear markers
- Replaced with a simple welcome message card

---

### 2. **ProfileLight.css** (`src/pages/ProfileLight.css`)

**New File Created** - Complete light theme stylesheet

#### Key Features:
- **White Background:** `background-color: #ffffff`
- **Dark Text:** `color: #111111` for primary text
- **Gray Text:** `color: #6b7280` for secondary text
- **Light Card Styling:** White cards with subtle borders
- **Button Hover Effects:** Smooth transitions with gray hover states
- **Gradient Preservation:** Maintains amber-to-purple gradient for branding
- **Shadow Updates:** Lighter, more subtle shadows for depth
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-friendly adjustments
- **Accessibility:** Focus states with amber outline

#### Override Strategy:
- Uses `!important` selectors to override dark theme
- Applies `.profile-light-theme` class to root container
- Overrides all card, background, and text color classes

## 🎨 Visual Changes

### Before:
- ❌ Dark background theme
- ❌ Social links prominently displayed

- ❌ No edit button for owners

### After:
- ✅ Clean white background
- ✅ Social links completely hidden

## 🔐 Security & Permissions

### Owner Detection:
```tsx

```

- Compares authenticated user ID with profile user ID
- Button only renders if match is found
- Uses Supabase authentication state

### Navigation:
- **Owner clicks "Edit My Profile"** → Redirects to `/dashboard`
- **Non-owners** → Button not visible at all
- **Not logged in** → Button hidden

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Why Hide Links?

- Focuses attention on profile information
- Removes gamification elements from public view

### Why Light Theme?
- More professional and traditional
- Better readability in most environments
- Aligns with modern SaaS aesthetics
- Higher contrast for accessibility

### Why Dashboard Redirect?
- Dashboard already has profile editing functionality
- No need to create separate edit page
- Maintains consistent user flow

## 🔧 Future Enhancements (Optional)

If you want to add more features later:

### 1. Toggle View Mode (Owner Only)
```tsx
const [showLinks, setShowLinks] = useState(false);

{isOwner && (
  <Button onClick={() => setShowLinks(!showLinks)}>
    {showLinks ? "Hide Links" : "Show Links"}
  </Button>
)}

{showLinks && (
  // Render social links here
)}
```

### 2. Theme Switcher
```tsx
const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');

<Button onClick={() => setTheme(theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light')}>
  Toggle Theme
</Button>
```

### 3. Custom Edit Page
Create a dedicated `/edit-profile` route instead of using dashboard.
