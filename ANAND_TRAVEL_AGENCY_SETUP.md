## How It Works

When anyone visits your website:
1. They immediately see the **Anand Travel Agency** profile
2. The profile displays your business name, logo/avatar, and welcome message
3. All your social media platform buttons are prominently displayed
4. Visitors can click any button to visit your social media pages
5. No login required - instant access for everyone!

## Database Configuration

The website automatically looks for a profile in your database with:
- Business name containing "anand" and "travel"

If no profile exists in the database, it shows default fallback content:
- Name: "Anand Travel Agency"
- Default welcome message
- Placeholder for social links

## Adding Social Media Links

To add your social media links to the profile:

1. You'll need to add entries to the `social_links` table in your Supabase database
2. Each link should have:
   - `user_id`: Your profile ID
   - `platform`: Name of the platform (e.g., "Facebook", "Instagram", "WhatsApp")
   - `url`: Full URL to your social media page
   - `order_index`: Order in which to display (0, 1, 2, etc.)

Example platforms you can add:
- Facebook
- Instagram
- WhatsApp
- Twitter/X
- LinkedIn
- YouTube
- TikTok
- Google Reviews
- Tripadvisor
- And any other social platform!

## Customization Options

You can easily customize:
- Profile image: Update `profile_image_url` in the database
- Business name: Update `business_name` in the profiles table
- Welcome message: Edit the text in `Index.tsx` (line with "Connect with us...")
- Colors and styling: Modify the Tailwind classes in `Index.tsx`
